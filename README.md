# Browser-PNGTuber-Engine (Not working yet)

## What is this?
Super rough webapp that connects with OBS / Streamlabs OBS to display PNG images based on user expression, voice, and eye position. 

## Development Log
### March 13
  Finished basic js that collects user information such as face expressoins, weather user is speaaking, and speaking volume. Encountered an issue where I absolutly don't know how to fix as OBS browers integration doesn't support mic or cam input. There seems to be a solution online somewhere, though that's all for today.
